 * Map-pass window size, set by the SMALLER of the two providers.

 * 8000 tokens per minute, and an over-budget request there returns 413, which is
 * not retryable — so a window sized for Cerebras makes the failover useless
 * exactly when it is needed.
 *
 * 14k chars is roughly 3.5k tokens, which leaves headroom for the system prompt
 * and the completion inside Groq's 8k. Raising this without raising the Groq

NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES (violating any = score 0):
1. The clip must open on something that grabs attention in the first 0.5 seconds — visible
   action, a striking visual, a surprising statement, or a clear stake being set. NEVER open on
   someone easing into a topic or giving throat-clearing context. The first FRAME is the thumbnail.
2. Never start mid-sentence or on filler ("so", "um", "and yeah", "okay so").
3. Never end mid-sentence. End on a punchline, payoff, clutch moment, or clear result.
4. Clip must make complete sense to someone who has NEVER seen the channel before.
5. Clip length must be between {MIN} and {MAX} seconds.

SCORING FACTORS (what earns a high score):
  +++ A clear conflict, contest, or unresolved question with a visible/audible stakes
  +++ A turn — reversal, reveal, escape, or realization — that lands in real time
  +++ Something at risk (a bet, a relationship, an outcome, a build, a trust)
  +++ A ticking clock or countdown where the outcome is unclear until the last second
  +++ A setup that pays off in one satisfying moment
  +++ A strong, genuine reaction — surprise, rage, celebration — that is the whole point
  ++ A moment that changes the state of the video's world (score, standing, relationship)
  ++ A concrete before/after reveal

NEVER nominate:
  - Pure exposition with no stakes (even if the words sound dramatic)
  - Setup clips that only make sense if you already know prior context
  - Clips starting on someone explaining what they are ABOUT to do
  - Intros, outros, sponsor reads, dead air

TITLE RULES (3-7 words):
  - Name the SPECIFIC conflict or challenge, not the category
  - Create a curiosity gap: viewer must watch to know the outcome
  - Present-tense or open question. No spoilers of the payoff.
  - Forbidden: "unexpected", "insane", "crazy", "wild", "you won't believe", hashtags

Return ONLY a JSON array. Each element:
{"start":"M:SS","end":"M:SS","title":"punchy 3-7 word hook","score":0-100,"reason":"why this works — specifically mention what the opening visual is"}
Order by score, best first. No prose outside the JSON.`;

Goal: pick the clips most likely to stop scrollers, get rewatched, and hit 10k+ views on YouTube Shorts.

Existing scores are from isolated windows and are NOT comparable. Ignore them.
Re-judge every candidate on one consistent scale.

PRIMARY RANK FACTOR — opening hook (counts 35%):
  Does the clip's stated opening timestamp land on something that grabs attention —
  action, a striking visual, a bold claim, a stake being set? High rank.
  Slow build-up, context explanation, throat-clearing = heavily penalised.

OTHER RANK FACTORS:
  - Stakes clear in <2 seconds without needing prior context
  - Tension escalates continuously — no dead air
  - Strong ending: elimination, escape, reveal, or reaction
  - Rewatchability: a twist or near-miss that rewards a second view
  - Specificity: names the actual thing happening, not vague drama

PENALISE HEAVILY:
  - Context-first openings (any clip that opens with someone explaining)
  - Dialogue-only moments, revenge framing with no visible action
  - Near-duplicates of a higher-scoring candidate (keep the best version only)
  - Clips > 32s that aren't continuously escalating

Use the full 0-100 range — spread scores out. A clip with a talking-head open should score < 55.
The top pick should have a score >= 85 only if it genuinely opens on visible action.
